## Organizing: How workshops happen. :boom:

Planning CodePath workshops should be visibile and transparent. Visibility makes it easier for us to help each other and show new organizers how we work. To jump in, checkout the [issues list](https://github.com/thecodepath/community-organizing/issues) of workshops currently being planned.

### Android Meetups

If you want to help organize for [Learning Android](http://www.meetup.com/Learning-Android-Development/), please sign up for the associated [android organizers google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/learning-android-development-organizers) to participate in discussions. If you are new, review the [CodePath Organizer Guide](https://docs.google.com/a/thecodepath.com/document/d/1G6pES4kA8Hy7568FNEsPg6VgO7iSCozGk8CEMNuKYIo/edit#) for a detailed look at how to make events happen.

Once an event has a firm date, the event should be added to the [Upcoming CodePath Meetups Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/thecodepath.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHkcGmlhOmqL0yz1g9c7Pmi4uFhFj-vLqsngYRk923E/edit#gid=1365436103). Enroll on that spreadsheet to sign up to help at the event.
